This paper presents one of the first approaches to provide the understanding of \textit{agro} (one of the unique eye attracting cues) headlines and thumbnails in online video sharing platform, Youtube. 

We annotated 1,881 headlines and thumbnails, based on \textit{agro} and the type of \textit{agro}. 
Then, we experimented with machine learning models to classify \textit{agro} data from the non-\textit{agro} data. 

With a Bi-LSTM model we achieved 84.35\% percent accuracy in detecting \textit{agro} headlines and 82.80\% percent accuracy in detecting \textit{agro} thumbnails. 


To sample our corpus, we used Youtube API to collect 10,000 headlines and thumbnails from Korean movie review channels in Youtube. These channels generally summarize the movie by skipping through the important plot with a complementary voice-over. We targeted the Korean movie channels in Youtube because they are noted for having \textit{agro} headlines and thumbnails. 

Three annotators who were enthusiastic about movies were gathered via one of the private universities in South Korea for the \textit{agro} labeling task. After explaining the annotators about the definition and examples of \textit{agro} headlines and thumbnails, we asked them to label the data based on the annotation guideline as follows:
